# Iperf3 data collector

A basic iperf3 collector that parse output of iperf log file with
basic regexp.
We are not using json output from iperf since data are available only
after the test is done. To get the data incrementally, you may want to
disable stdout line buffering, with stdbuf utility for instance, and
redirect the logs to a file:

```
stdbuf -o0 iperf3 -s | tee /tmp/iperfs.log
```
